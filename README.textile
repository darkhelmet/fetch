h2. What is it?

fetch is a full text search engine and server written in "go":http://golang.org/

h2. How?

bc. POST '{ "title": "My Blog Post", "body": "Ruby is the bomb..." }' /blog/posts/5 (/:index/:scope/:id)

h3. Pipeline

JSON parts -> Tokenizer -> Analyzer -> Storage

h3. Tokenzier

bc. String -> TokenChan

h3. Analyzer

Tokens maybe have a type/flag/something and analyzers only work on certain filters?

bc. TokenChan -> email -> superstrip(invalid characters, ascii, strip, lowercase) -> stopword -> stemming -> double_metaphone -> ngram? -> TokenChan

h3. Storage

bc.. storage.Index(index, scope, id, field, tokens)

storage.Search(index, scope, query) # -> List of ids

h2. Quick start
